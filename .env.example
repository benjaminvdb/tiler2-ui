# Sentry Error Monitoring Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Sentry is COMPLETELY DISABLED in development (NODE_ENV=development)
# Sentry.init() is NOT called at all in development - zero network requests to Sentry
# In development, all logs go to console only - no data sent to Sentry
# This prevents development exceptions from polluting production Sentry logs

# For PRODUCTION/STAGING: Uncomment and set these environment variables
# Sentry will ONLY initialize when both conditions are met:
#   1. NODE_ENV is NOT 'development'
#   2. SENTRY_DSN is explicitly set (no hardcoded fallback)

# Server-side DSN (for server/edge runtime):
# SENTRY_DSN='https://your-key@o0.ingest.sentry.io/project-id'

# Client-side DSN (for browser - can be same as server):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN='https://your-key@o0.ingest.sentry.io/project-id'

# Sentry Auth Token for source map upload (required for production builds)
# Get this from: https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
# Requires scopes: project:read, project:releases, org:read
# SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN='sntrys_your-token-here'

# Sentry Environment (optional - defaults to NODE_ENV)
# SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT='production'

# Sentry Project Configuration:
# - Organization: link-nature
# - Project: link-ai-frontend
# - Tunnel route: /monitoring (bypasses ad-blockers)
# - Session Replay: 10% sessions, 100% on error
# - Performance monitoring enabled
# - Conditional initialization: only when DSN is set + production environment

# Logging Configuration
# Log level for server-side Pino (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
# Default: info
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Enable pretty printing in development (true/false)
# Default: true (automatically enabled in development)
LOG_PRETTY=true
